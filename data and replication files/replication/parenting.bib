	Abstract = {Purpose: To examine the role of self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, and perception of peer attitudes in the delay of onset of sexual activity among 13- through 15-year-old adolescents. We also explored the role of self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, and perception of friends' condom use behavior in explaining the use of condoms among sexually active adolescents.

Methods: This study was part of a larger cross-sectional study to evaluate personal characteristics and maternal factors associated with early initiation of sexual intercourse. Mothers and adolescents were recruited from a community-based organization that offered afterschool and summer programs for youth. Enrollment was limited to adolescents aged 13{\textendash}15 years and their mothers. Mothers and adolescents completed separate interviews. For adolescents, the interviews included the assessment of the variables in the present study. Each interview lasted about 60 min and was conducted by a trained interviewer. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and regression analysis. The average age of the 405 adolescent participants was 13.86 years, and approximately 30\% of them had engaged in sexual intercourse. Slightly more than half (56\%) of participants were male, and 82\% were African-American.

Results: Participants who were less likely to believe that their friends favored intercourse for adolescents and who held more favorable attitudes about the personal benefits of abstaining from sex were less likely to have initiated sexual intercourse. Among sexually active adolescents, those who expressed confidence in putting on a condom, and in being able to refuse sex with a sexual partner, and who expressed more favorable outcome expectancies associated with using a condom were more likely to use condoms consistently.

Conclusions: Human immunodeficiency virus and pregnancy prevention programs should emphasize peer influences in both the initiation of sexual intercourse and the use of safer sex practices among sexually active adolescents, as well as personal attitudes about consequences to self and confidence in negotiating safer sex practices with one's partner.},

	Abstract = {This study aims at investigating the impact of parental practices on youths' adjustment. In all, 605 adolescents completed questionnaires at ages 14, 16 and 18. Self-esteem, psychological distress as well as parental emotional support and coercive control were measured. Analyses based on individual growth models revealed that self-esteem increased with age, but psychological distress remained stable over time. Boys reported higher levels of self-esteem and lower levels of psychological distress than girls. Maternal and paternal emotional support reinforced self-esteem over time. Maternal coercive control undermined self-esteem, but only at ages 16 and 18. Psychological distress decreased with parental emotional support but increased with parental coercive control at ages 14, 16 and 18. Overall, these results indicate that positive parental practices are related to youths' well-being. These findings support the importance of establishing intervention strategies designed to promote best practices among parents of teenagers to help them develop into well-adjusted adults.},

@article{Maher:2011,
	Abstract = {This article uses statewide data on caregivers of young children referred to the Nurturing Parenting Program (NPP) for allegations of abuse and neglect to examine the relationship between program dosage and subsequent maltreatment. At six months after participating in the program, caregivers who attended more sessions were significantly less likely to be reported for child maltreatment, holding other factors constant. At two years after participating, caregivers attending more sessions were significantly less likely to have a substantiated maltreatment incidence, controlling for other characteristics of families associated with maltreatment. These findings demonstrate the program is associated with preventing short-term allegations and longer-term substantiated incidences of maltreatment for a child welfare population. By demonstrating the importance of participation in the NPP, we increase the evidence about effective parent education programs for this population.},

@article{Mills:2011,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between child maltreatment (abuse and neglect) and long-term cognitive outcomes within a prospective birth cohort.
METHODS: A birth cohort of 7223 children was recruited. Independent reports of suspected child maltreatment were confidentially linked to the longitudinal study database. The principal predictor variable was notification to the state child-protection authority for suspected maltreatment (abuse, neglect, or both). The outcome variables were scores on the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) reading test and Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM), completed at 14 years of age. Multivariate regression analysis was used to adjust for potential confounders.
RESULTS: A total of 3796 subjects completed either the WRAT or RSPM. There was a higher loss to follow-up among children who had been reported to the state as suspected victims of maltreatment. After controlling for a range of possible confounders and modifiers, notification to the state for child maltreatment (abuse, neglect, or both) was associated with a lower score on both the WRAT (mean difference: -4.4 when the SD is 15 \[95\% confidence interval: -6.3 to -2.5\]) and RSPM (mean difference: -4.8 when the SD is 15 \[95\% confidence interval: -6.7 to -2.9\]). Both reported abuse and neglect were independently associated with lower reading ability and perceptual reasoning.
CONCLUSIONS: Both child abuse and child neglect are independently associated with impaired cognition and academic functioning in adolescence. These findings suggest that both abuse and neglect have independent and important adverse effects on a child's cognitive development.},

@article{Uji:2014,
	Abstract = {Few studies in Japan have examined whether children's later mental health is influenced by the way parental authority is exercised, specifically with a focus on gender. Our main purposes of this study were to confirm the three-factor structure of the Japanese version of the Parental Authority Questionnaire (PAQ) and to verify its reliability and validity. We then used structural equation modeling to examine whether children's later mental health was influenced by parents' authoritative, permissive, and authoritarian parenting. The subcategories included in the Japanese version of the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure were chosen as mental health indices. A total of 1,320 people in Japan, including company employees, university students, and hospital staff members, were asked to recall and evaluate the parenting they received and to report on their current mental health. Confirmatory factor analyses verified the three-factor structure of the Japanese version of the PAQ, with a reduction in the number of items from the original version. The respondents, regardless of gender, evaluated their mothers as having been more authoritative than their fathers. Concerning the impact of parenting styles on respondents' later mental health, both maternal and paternal authoritarian parenting styles worsened respondents' later mental health, including symptomatic problems, risk to self and others, life functioning, and psychological well-being. Both maternal and paternal authoritative parenting had a beneficial impact on respondents' later mental health. Simultaneous analyses of multi-groups demonstrated that the nature of these influences did not vary with respondent gender. We present the above results in detail, and discuss them from psycho-socio-cultural viewpoints.},

	Abstract = {Applied researchers often include mediation effects in applications of advanced methods such as latent variable models and linear growth curve models. Guidance on how to estimate statistical power to detect mediation for these models has not yet been addressed in the literature. We describe a general framework for power analyses for complex mediational models. The approach is based on the well known technique of generating a large number of samples in a Monte Carlo study, and estimating power as the percentage of cases in which an estimate of interest is significantly different from zero. Examples of power calculation for commonly used mediational models are provided. Power analyses for the single mediator, multiple mediators, three-path mediation, mediation with latent variables, moderated mediation, and mediation in longitudinal designs are described. Annotated sample syntax for Mplus is appended and tabled values of required sample sizes are shown for some models.},

	Abstract = {Summary
Poverty and associated health, nutrition, and social factors prevent at least 200 million children in developing countries from attaining their developmental potential. We review the evidence linking compromised development with modifiable biological and psychosocial risks encountered by children from birth to 5 years of age. We identify four key risk factors where the need for intervention is urgent: stunting, inadequate cognitive stimulation, iodine deficiency, and iron deficiency anaemia. The evidence is also sufficient to warrant interventions for malaria, intrauterine growth restriction, maternal depression, exposure to violence, and exposure to heavy metals. We discuss the research needed to clarify the effect of other potential risk factors on child development. The prevalence of the risk factors and their effect on development and human potential are substantial. Furthermore, risks often occur together or cumulatively, with concomitant increased adverse effects on the development of the world's poorest children.},

	Abstract = {The existing literature on statistical power analysis for mediation models often assumes data normality and is based on a less powerful Sobel test instead of the more powerful bootstrap test. This study proposes to estimate statistical power to detect mediation effects on the basis of the bootstrap method through Monte Carlo simulation. Nonnormal data with excessive skewness and kurtosis are allowed in the proposed method. A free R package called bmem is developed to conduct the power analysis discussed in this study. Four examples, including a simple mediation model, a multiple-mediator model with a latent mediator, a multiple-group mediation model, and a longitudinal mediation model, are provided to illustrate the proposed method.},

@article{Barlow:2012,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parental psychosocial health can have a significant effect on the parent-child relationship, with consequences for the later psychological health of the child. Parenting programmes have been shown to have an impact on the emotional and behavioural adjustment of children, but there have been no reviews to date of their impact on parental psychosocial wellbeing. OBJECTIVES: To address whether group-based parenting programmes are effective in improving parental psychosocial wellbeing (for example, anxiety, depression, guilt, confidence). SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases on 5 December 2012: CENTRAL (2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1950 to November 2011), EMBASE (1980 to week 48, 2011), BIOSIS (1970 to 2 December 2011), CINAHL (1982 to November 2011), PsycINFO (1970 to November week 5, 2011), ERIC (1966 to November 2011), Sociological Abstracts (1952 to November 2011), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to 2 December 2011), metaRegister of Controlled Trials (5 December 2011), NSPCC Library (5 December 2011). We searched ASSIA (1980 to current) on 10 November 2012 and the National Research Register was last searched in 2005. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials that compared a group-based parenting programme with a control condition and used at least one standardised measure of parental psychosocial health. Control conditions could be waiting-list, no treatment, treatment as usual or a placebo. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors extracted data independently and assessed the risk of bias in each study. We examined the studies for any information on adverse effects. We contacted authors where information was missing from trial reports. We standardised the treatment effect for each outcome in each study by dividing the mean difference in post-intervention scores between the intervention and control groups by the pooled standard deviation. MAIN RESULTS: We included 48 studies that involved 4937 participants and covered three types of programme: behavioural, cognitive-behavioural and multimodal. Overall, we found that group-based parenting programmes led to statistically significant short-term improvements in depression (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.17, 95\% confidence interval (CI) -0.28 to -0.07), anxiety (SMD -0.22, 95\% CI -0.43 to -0.01), stress (SMD -0.29, 95\% CI -0.42 to -0.15), anger (SMD -0.60, 95\% CI -1.00 to -0.20), guilt (SMD -0.79, 95\% CI -1.18 to -0.41), confidence (SMD -0.34, 95\% CI -0.51 to -0.17) and satisfaction with the partner relationship (SMD -0.28, 95\% CI -0.47 to -0.09). However, only stress and confidence continued to be statistically significant at six month follow-up, and none were significant at one year. There was no evidence of any effect on self-esteem (SMD -0.01, 95\% CI -0.45 to 0.42). None of the trials reported on aggression or adverse effects.The limited data that explicitly focused on outcomes for fathers showed a statistically significant short-term improvement in paternal stress (SMD -0.43, 95\% CI -0.79 to -0.06). We were unable to combine data for other outcomes and individual study results were inconclusive in terms of any effect on depressive symptoms, confidence or partner satisfaction. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this review support the use of parenting programmes to improve the short-term psychosocial wellbeing of parents. Further input may be required to ensure that these results are maintained. More research is needed that explicitly addresses the benefits for fathers, and that examines the comparative effectiveness of different types of programme along with the mechanisms by which such programmes bring about improvements in parental psychosocial functioning.},

Preschoolers (n = 153) at risk for conduct problems were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 104) and wait-list (n = 49) groups. Boys and younger children, and those with more depressed mothers, tended to show greater improvement in conduct problems post-intervention. Other risk factors (i.e., teen or single parenthood, very low income, high initial levels of problem behavior) showed no predictive effects, implying intervention was at least as successful at helping the most disadvantaged families, compared to more advantaged. Mediator analyses found change in positive parenting skill predicted change in conduct problems.},

	Abstract = {Purpose Conduct problems and emotional distress have been identified as key problems among children and adolescents in post-war Burundi. This pilot study aims to evaluate the impact of a brief parenting psychoeducation intervention on children's mental health. Methods This study employs a controlled pre and post evaluation design. The two-session psychoeducation intervention was offered to groups of parents of children (mean age 12.3 years, 60.8 \% female) who had been screened for elevated psychosocial distress. Children in the intervention group (n = 58) were compared to a waitlist control group (n = 62). Outcome indicators included child-reported levels of aggression (using the Aggression Questionnaire), depression symptoms (using the Depression Self Rating Scale) and perceived family social support. Results The intervention had a beneficial effect on reducing conduct problems compared to the control condition (Cohen d = 0.60), especially among boys, while not showing impact on depression symptoms or family social support. Parents evaluated the intervention positively, with increased awareness of positive parenting strategies and appropriate disciplinary techniques reported as the most common learning points. Conclusion A brief parenting psychoeducation intervention conducted by lay community counselors is a promising public health strategy in dealing with widespread conduct problems in boys living in violence-affected settings and not so for social and emotional indicators and for girls. An efficacy study is warranted to confirm these preliminary findings.},

@article{Thornberry:2011,
	Abstract = {Analogue behavioral observations are an important component of multi-modal, multi-informant assessments. The Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System (DPICS) is a structured behavior observation system developed to assess the frequency and quality of parent and child behaviors during a structured dyadic interaction. The DPICS includes two, five-minute warm-up (WU) segments before coded segments; these WU segments are thought to allow dyads time to acclimate to observation instructions and improve the representativeness of sampled behavior. To date, there are no published studies addressing the usefulness of warm-up (WU) segments in a community-based treatment setting. This study analyzed the contribution of including WU segments in DPICS observations by comparing mean parent and child behavior composite frequency counts obtained from a community sample of 13 mother-child dyads. Comparisons were made between pre- and post-treatment DPICS WU and typically-coded (TC) segments. No significant differences were found between WU and TC segments at pre- or post-treatment DPICS observations. The implications of our findings for the utility of WU segments are discussed, along with suggestions for future directions in research.},

@article{Jurgensen:2013,
	Abstract = {HIV-related stigma continues to be a prominent barrier to testing, treatment and care. However, few studies have investigated changes in stigma over time and the factors contributing to these changes, and there is no evidence of the impact of HIV testing and counselling on stigma. This study was nested within a pair-matched cluster-randomized trial on the acceptance of home-based voluntary HIV counselling and testing conducted in a rural district in Zambia between 2009 and 2011, and investigated changes in stigma over time and the impact of HIV testing and counselling on stigma. Data from a baseline survey (n = 1500) and a follow-up survey (n = 1107) were used to evaluate changes in stigma. There was an overall reduction of seven per cent in stigma from baseline to follow-up. This was mainly due to a reduction in individual stigmatizing attitudes but not in perceived stigma. The reduction did not differ between the trial arms (β = −0.22, p = 0.423). Being tested for HIV was associated with a reduction in stigma (β = −0.57, p = 0.030), and there was a trend towards home-based Voluntary Counselling and Testing having a larger impact on stigma than other testing approaches (β = −0.78, p = 0.080 vs. β = −0.37, p = 0.551), possibly explained by a strong focus on counselling and the safe environment of the home. The reduction observed in both arms may give reason to be optimistic as it may have consequences for disclosure, treatment access and adherence. Yet, the change in stigma may have been affected by social desirability bias, as extensive community mobilization was carried out in both arms. The study underscores the challenges in measuring and monitoring HIV-related stigma. Adjustment for social desirability bias and inclusion of qualitative methods are recommended for further studies on the impact of HIV testing on stigma.},

	Abstract = {The effectiveness of the Incredible Years Basic parent programme (IYBP) in reducing child conduct problems and improving parent competencies and mental health was examined in a 12-month follow-up. Pre- to post-intervention service use and related costs were also analysed. A total of 103 families and their children (aged 32--88 months), who previously participated in a randomised controlled trial of the IYBP, took part in a 12-month follow-up assessment. Child and parent behaviour and well-being were measured using psychometric and observational measures. An intention-to-treat analysis was carried out using a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Pairwise comparisons were subsequently conducted to determine whether treatment outcomes were sustained 1 year post-baseline assessment. Results indicate that post-intervention improvements in child conduct problems, parenting behaviour and parental mental health were maintained. Service use and associated costs continued to decline. The results indicate that parent-focused interventions, implemented in the early years, can result in improvements in child and parent behaviour and well-being 12 months later. A reduced reliance on formal services is also indicated.},

	Abstract = {Objective: A community-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in urban areas characterized by high levels of disadvantage to test the effectiveness of the Incredible Years BASIC parent training program (IYBP) for children with behavioral problems. Potential moderators of intervention effects on child behavioral outcomes were also explored. Method: Families were included if the child (aged 32--88 months) scored above a clinical cutoff on the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI). Participants (n = 149) were randomly allocated on a 2:1 ratio to an intervention group (n = 103) or a waiting-list control group (n = 46). Child behavior, parenting skills, and parent well-being were assessed at baseline and 6 months later using parent-report and independent observations. An intention-to-treat analysis of covariance was used to examine postintervention differences between groups. Results: Statistically significant differences in child disordered behavior favored the intervention group on the ECBI Intensity (effect size = 0.7, p \ensuremath{<} .001) and Problem subscales (effect size = 0.75, p \ensuremath{<} .001). Intervention effects on child hyperactive-inattentive behaviors and social competence, as well as parent competencies and well-being, were also found. Moderator analyses showed that the effects of the IYBP intervention on the primary child outcomes were not moderated by child or family demographic characteristics or risk factors. Conclusion: The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the IYBP in alleviating problem behavior among children and in improving well-being among families living in disadvantaged areas. The findings also highlight the importance of parental intervention in early childhood for parents and children most in need of support.},

	Abstract = {The use of self-help interventions for parents of children with behaviour problems is becoming more prevalent. This review critically evaluated the evidence supporting the efficacy of such programmes for children with behaviour problems. Using a systematic literature search, two modes of delivery were evaluated, namely bibliotherapy and multimedia. Programmes that included minimal therapist support were also included. Overall, there is good evidence supporting the efficacy of self-help programmes in improving child behaviour, over the short and longer term. Self-help programmes led to outcomes similar to those achieved with more intensive therapist input. Including minimal levels of therapist support in addition to self-help materials enhances child and parent outcomes. Parents view self-help favourably but significantly less so than programmes including some form of therapist input. The future directions for self-help parent programmes include the need for longer-term follow-ups, the identification of moderators of outcome and economic evaluations of self-help programmes.},

	Abstract = {Although many interventions address children's externalizing behavior problems, negative treatment outcomes remain common. Reasons for success or failure are frequently unclear, due in part to a lack of research identifying treatment change mechanisms. The current study evaluated differential attention as a mechanism of change in Parent--Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), a treatment for children with externalizing problems. Using sequential coding and time-series analysis, we examined parent--child interactions across treatment for three families. Contrary to hypotheses, child prosocial behaviors and parent skill use held steady or decreased across coaching periods, with the exception of one family, where the parent's skill use increased during coaching. Partial support was found for the hypothesis that parent differential attention would predict child prosocial behavior in the next minute. These results provide support for differential attention as a mechanism of change, but also demonstrate that this factor is not the only such mechanism.},

Ss were 22 families referred for treatment of a conduct problem child (2--7 yrs of age) and 22 normal families observed in the laboratory in child-directed and parent-directed interactions. The conduct problem children displayed higher rates of noncompliance than normal children, and their parents were more critical and directive than normal parents. Both the referred child and its sibling exhibited behavior problems in conduct problem families, but the referred child was deviant in a greater variety of situations than the sibling. The DPICS was a reliable, clinically practical, research instrument that correctly classified 94\% of families and predicted 61\% of the variance in parent report of home behavior problems. The effectiveness of this brief procedure may be attributable to the structure of the clinic observation situations, which varied in degree of parental control. (2 ref)},

Sixty home visiting programs contributed data to analysis within 5 child and 5 parent outcome groups. Standardized effect sizes were computed for each end-of-treatment outcome measure, for each treatment versus control contrast. Weighted mean standardized effect sizes ranged from --.043 to .318; 6 of the 10 significantly differed from 0. No one program characteristic consistently affected effect sizes across outcome groups.

	Abstract = {We conducted a review and meta-analyses of 24 studies to evaluate and compare the outcomes of two widely disseminated parenting interventions---Parent-Child Interaction Therapy and Triple P-Positive Parenting Program. Participants in all studies were caregivers and 3- to 12-year-old children. In general, our analyses revealed positive effects of both interventions, but effects varied depending on intervention length, components, and source of outcome data. Both interventions reduced parent-reported child behavior and parenting problems. The effect sizes for PCIT were large when outcomes of child and parent behaviors were assessed with parent-report, with the exclusion of Abbreviated PCIT, which had moderate effect sizes. All forms of Triple P had moderate to large effects when outcomes were parent-reported child behaviors and parenting, with the exception of Media Triple P, which had small effects. PCIT and an enhanced version of Triple P were associated with improvements in observed child behaviors. These findings provide information about the relative efficacy of two programs that have received substantial funding in the USA and Australia, and findings should assist in making decisions about allocations of funding and dissemination of these parenting interventions in the future.},

@article{Webster-Stratton:2011,
	Abstract = {Background and method: Fifty-eight boys and 20 girls with early onset conduct problems whose parents received the Incredible Years (IY) parent treatment program when they were 3--8 years (mean 58.7 months) were contacted and reassessed regarding their social and emotional adjustment 8--12 years later. Assessments included home interviews with parents and teenagers separately.Results and conclusion: Adolescent reports indicated that 10\% were in the clinical range on internalising behaviours, 23\% had engaged in major delinquent acts, and 46\% reported some substance use. Eighteen percent of children had criminal justice system involvement and 42\% had elevated levels of externalising behaviours (mother report). Post-treatment factors predicting negative outcomes (delinquent acts) were maternal reports of behaviour problems and observed mother--child coercion.},
